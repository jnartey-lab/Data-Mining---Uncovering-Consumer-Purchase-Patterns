## Data Mining - Uncovering Consumer Purchase Patterns Using Market Basket Analysis and Frequent Pattern Mining

## 1. Introduction:

• The project focuses on analyzing a UK retail transaction dataset to uncover frequently purchased product combinations using the Apriori Algorithm and FP-Growth Algorithms. This analysis aims to enhance customer experiences and optimize marketing strategies for increased sales growth.

• The dataset, containing transactional data, is obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## 2. Data Exploration:

• The dataset is loaded into a pandas DataFrame, and basic data exploration is conducted to understand its structure, size (541,909 rows and 8 columns), and data types.

• Key columns in the dataset include invoice number, stock code, description, quantity, price, and customer information.

## 3. Data Preprocessing:

• The data is cleaned and prepared for analysis. This step includes removing irrelevant columns, handling missing values, and ensuring that the data is in a suitable format for subsequent analysis.

## 4. Association Rule Mining:

• The Apriori and FP-Growth algorithms are applied to identify frequent itemsets from the transactional data.

• After identifying frequent itemsets, association rules are generated to uncover relationships between products that are frequently purchased together.

## 5. Analysis and Insights:

• The total number of unique invoices is calculated, offering insight into the dataset's scale and the frequency of transactions.

• The project continues with the analysis of frequent itemsets and visualizations to identify patterns, with the aim of extracting actionable insights for improving marketing strategies and product recommendations.

# Findings:

**Consistent Patterns Across Algorithms:**

By using both the Apriori and FP-Growth Algorithms, strong purchasing patterns in the retail dataset were identified. The consistency of these patterns across both methods demonstrates the robustness of the itemsets and association rules found.

**Analysis of Rules:**

Various metrics, such as support, confidence, lift, leverage, conviction, Kulczynski, and Jaccard, were used to evaluate the association rules. These metrics helped to clarify the strength and significance of the identified relationships between products.

**Key Product Findings:**

Teacup products emerged as the strongest rules, with high scores across all metrics. The rules associated with teacups indicated that when customers buy a specific color of teacup, they are very likely to purchase another color variation from the same series.

Lift values over 20, confidence above 80%, Kulczynski scores around 0.73, and conviction values reaching up to 10.29 confirm the strength of these associations.

Similar patterns were observed for products with multiple variations, such as lunchboxes and alarm clocks, which also have different color options. Seasonal items like Christmas décor products also showed strong purchasing patterns.

# Recommendations:

**Bundle Promotions:**

Based on the strong associations found, it is recommended to create product bundles for items that are frequently bought together, such as teacup sets, lunchboxes, and other products with color variations.

Promotional strategies, such as “Buy 2, Get 1 Free” offers, can encourage customers to purchase multiple products in the same category. For instance, customers can be encouraged to buy a rose, pink, and green teacup set together.

**Cross-Sell Strategies:**

Implement cross-selling strategies by recommending related products at key points during the customer journey, such as on product pages or at checkout.

For example, when a customer adds one teacup set to their cart, other teacup sets can be recommended, taking advantage of the high likelihood that customers who buy one teacup are likely to purchase others.

**Product Grouping:**

To encourage pattern behavior, group similar products physically in stores or digitally on e-commerce websites. Since the discovered rules are bi-directional, displaying items like teacups together increases the likelihood of them being bought together.

**Stock Management:**

Ensure that sufficient stock levels are maintained for popular products, especially during peak seasons or promotional periods, to meet the demand generated by these strong purchasing patterns.

Having adequate stock can help prevent potential losses due to product unavailability, especially for high-demand items like teacup sets, lunchboxes, and seasonal products.

By leveraging these findings, businesses can optimize their marketing strategies, increase sales growth, and enhance the customer shopping experience through targeted promotions, cross-selling, and careful product display strategies.
