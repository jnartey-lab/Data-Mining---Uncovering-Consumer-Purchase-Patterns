Data Mining - Uncovering Consumer Purchase Patterns Using Market Basket Analysis and Frequent Pattern Mining
1. Introduction:

• The project focuses on analyzing a UK retail transaction dataset to uncover frequently purchased product combinations using the Apriori Algorithm and FP-Growth Algorithms. This analysis aims to enhance customer experiences and optimize marketing strategies for increased sales growth.

• The dataset, containing transactional data, is obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

2. Data Exploration:

• The dataset is loaded into a pandas DataFrame, and basic data exploration is conducted to understand its structure, size (541,909 rows and 8 columns), and data types.

• Key columns in the dataset include invoice number, stock code, description, quantity, price, and customer information.

3. Data Preprocessing:

• The data is cleaned and prepared for analysis. This step includes removing irrelevant columns, handling missing values, and ensuring that the data is in a suitable format for subsequent analysis.

4. Association Rule Mining:

• The Apriori and FP-Growth algorithms are applied to identify frequent itemsets from the transactional data.

• After identifying frequent itemsets, association rules are generated to uncover relationships between products that are frequently purchased together.

5. Analysis and Insights:

• The total number of unique invoices is calculated, offering insight into the dataset's scale and the frequency of transactions.

• The project continues with the analysis of frequent itemsets and visualizations to identify patterns, with the aim of extracting actionable insights for improving marketing strategies and product recommendations.

Conclusion:

• The project uses data mining techniques to explore customer purchasing behaviors, providing valuable insights that can improve product recommendations, marketing strategies, and sales optimization for retail businesses.# Data-Mining---Uncovering-Consumer-Purchase-Patterns
